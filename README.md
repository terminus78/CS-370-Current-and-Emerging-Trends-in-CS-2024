**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

>The point of this project was to have an AI driven agent attempt to solve a maze puzzle to reach the treasure. My job was to develop the deep-Q learning algorithm to train the AI and have it exploit its knowlege once trained.

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

>Computer scientist research and develop solutions involving computers. Computer scientists are important due to the prolific nature of technology and computers in general in this modern world. Behind every step computers have taken was computer science and those who have progressed the field.

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

>As a computer scientist, I apply critical thinking to problems faced in this field. When the inevitable bug, design flaw, or implementation error occurs, I ensure that I fully understand the problem, use research and experience to tackle the issue, and develop a solution to the problem. I then verify that the problem is adequately fixed through the use of testing.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

>I am ethically responsible to ensure that I develop code that is as free of errors as possible, offer my technical expertise in decision making process where that knowlege may influence the outcome, handle data with care and security, work as a team to develop better solutions together, communicate often and early, and help to develop every subsequent generation of developers.
